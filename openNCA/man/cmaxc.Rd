\title{Corrected CMAXi}
\usage{
cmaxc(kel = NULL, cmax = NULL, c0 = NULL, tmax = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{conc}{The concentration data (given in a vector form)}

\item{time}{The time data (given in a vector form)}
}
\description{
CMAXi corrected using estimates of KEL and C0. i refers to the value of NDOSEI. The correct 
CMAXCi (and the other corrections below) should be triggered for computation when the FLAG 
for predose concentrations >5% of Cmax are observed has been set. This would ordinarily apply 
to CMAXC1, i.e. the first dosing interval of a concentration time profile. \cr
